My dotfiles repository.
Everything is organised around topic folders such as :
- vim
- bash
- git
- tmux

This should be manageable by GNU Stow in a near future.

## thanks
I forked [Zach Holman](http://github.com/holman') excellent
[dotfiles](http://github.com/holman/dotfiles) to setup this repository.
